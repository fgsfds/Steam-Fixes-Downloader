**Steam Fixes Downloader** is an app which main purpose is to easily download and install fixes for games on Steam that have problems running on modern systems.

It contains an ever-growing curated list of widescreen fixes, unofficial patches, crash fixes, etc, and a way to install, update, and uninstall them, or even submit your own fixes (*this feature is WIP*).
