**Steam Superheater** is an app which main purpose is to easily download and install fixes for Steam games that have problems running on modern systems.

It contains an ever-growing curated list of widescreen fixes, unofficial patches, crash fixes, etc. It provides a way to install, update, uninstall fixes or even submit your own.

Currently it only supports Windows. Linux and Deck support coming later.
