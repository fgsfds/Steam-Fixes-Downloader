<b>Steam Superheater</b> is an app which main purpose is to make it easy to install various must-have fixes and patches for Steam games.

The ever-growing list of fixes includes, but not limited to: (ultra)widescreen fixes, crash workarounds, unofficial patches, modern source ports for older games, no intro fixes. 

It's not meant to be an ultimate mod manager, but rather an easy way to fix and improve Steam games that are broken or have troubles running on modern systems out of the box.

Superheater is standalone and <b>doesn't require Steam credentials</b> or any other sensitive information to work.

Installing fixes is done by pressing a single button: no third-party installers or fiddling around with files, folders or registry is necessary. Just press Install and then run the game normally from Steam.

Same for uninstalling and updating: original files are backed up and restored when the fix is uninstalled.

Fixes are hand-picked, verified, and prepared (if needed) by me. Some are downloaded directly from the fix developer's GitHub, some a repacked to support single-button install and put into <a href="https://github.com/fgsfds/SteamFD-Fixes-Repo">my fixes repo</a>.

Superheater also includes fixes <b>editor</b> which allows users who want to help fixes database grow to add and submit their own fixes.

After review, user-submitted fixes will be added to the public database.
